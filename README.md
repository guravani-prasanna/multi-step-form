# Multi-Step Form Application

## Project Overview
This project is a multi-step form application built using React. It allows users to navigate between multiple steps of a form, validates input at each step, and provides the ability to review and edit entries before final submission. The form data persists in `localStorage` to ensure data is not lost on page reload.
